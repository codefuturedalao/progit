What is Git?
	1. SnapShots,Not Differences
	2. Nearly Every Operation is Local
Three States:
	1. Modified	 (was changed since it was cheched out but has boe been staged)
	2. Staged	 (has been modified and was added to the staging area)
	3. Committed (in Git Directory)

Three main sections of a git project:
	1. Working Directory:	is a single checkout of one version of the project
	2. Staging Area: is a file, generally contained in your Git directory,
	that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
	3. Git Directory: is where Gir stores the metadata and onject database for
	your project.

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
	1. you modify files in your working tree.
	2. you selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your
	next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.
	3. you do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area
	and stores that sanpshot premanently to your Git directory.
