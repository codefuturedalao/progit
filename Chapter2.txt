1. Geting a Git Repository
1.1 intializing a repository in an existing directory
	git init
1.2 cloning an Existing repository
	git clone https://
	git clone https://xxx yyy(xxx's alias name)
	but you may also see git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the
SSH transfer protocol.

2. Recording Changes to the Repository
	Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two
	states: tracked or untracked.
	Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be
	unmodified,modified,staged.In short,tracked files are files that Git knows
	about.
	Untracked files are everything else----any files in your working directory
	that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
2.1 Checking the Status of Your Files
	git status
2.2 Tracking New Files
	git add
	the git add command takes a path name for either a file or a directory, if
	it's a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory
	recursively.
3.3 Staging Modified Files
	git add
	Caution: Git staged a file exactly as it is when you run the git add
	command. if you modify a file after you run git add,you HAVE TO run git
	add to stage the LATEST version of the file
