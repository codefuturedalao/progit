1. Git Branching 

	git branch <branchName>

	Branching means you diverge from the main line of developmeny and continue
	to work without mess with that main line

	1. when you create the commit by running git commit, what happens?
		Git checksums each subdirectory and stores them as a tree object in
	the Git repository.
		Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata(author,email
	and etc) and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that
	snapshot when needed

	2. what happens when you create a new branch? 
		Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around.
	
	3. how does Git know what branch you're currently on?
		It keeps a special pointer caled HEAD
1.1 Switching Branches
	git checkout <branchName>					(tag is the same usage,see in Chapter2.txt)
	
	git checkout -b <branchName>		create a new branch adn switch to it
	Notice:		if you don't commit your changes and you checkout,you will lose 
			your changes!
