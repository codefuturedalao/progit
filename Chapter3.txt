What is a branch?
	a branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these
	commits
1. Creating a New Branch
	git branch <branchName>
	1. What happens when you create a new branch? 
		Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around.
	2. How does Git know what branch you're currently on?
		It keeps a special pointer called HEAD.
	Notice: the git branch command only created a new branch--it didn't switch
	to that branch.
2. Switching Branches
	git checkout <branchName>
